				<h3>Sword</h3>
				<p>The sword of the Witch-king of Angmar is not merely a weapon—it is a symbol of malice, corruption, and fear. Forged in the dark furnaces of Mordor, it carries an aura of cold, unnatural power that chills even the bravest warrior. Its jagged, cruel edges are designed not just to wound, but to curse those it strikes, weakening their will and clouding their senses. Unlike the elegant blades of Elves or the sturdy craftsmanship of Dwarves, the Witch-king’s sword is a brutal extension of his wrath. In battle, he wields it with terrifying precision, carving through armor and hope alike. The blade is often shrouded in a pale, spectral mist—echoes of the magic that sustains his undead form. To face it is to feel the weight of ancient evil pressing down, reminding all that the Dark Lord’s reach extends beyond the grave.

				<h3>Mace</h3>
				<p>When the sword no longer suffices, the Witch-king turns to his devastating mace—an iron monstrosity that exemplifies brute strength and merciless domination. This massive, spiked weapon is wielded with terrifying ease by the Nazgûl lord, its every swing capable of shattering shields, bones, and morale in equal measure. It is not a subtle tool; it is a declaration of overwhelming force, meant to obliterate rather than duel. The clang of it crashing into stone or steel reverberates like a death knell, an announcement that resistance is futile. In the Battle of Pelennor Fields, the Witch-king's mace became infamous for its destruction, smashing through ranks of Gondorian soldiers as if they were paper. Each strike carries the weight of centuries of malice and undeath, powered by sorcery and hate. Few can stand before it—and fewer still live to tell the tale.

			<div>
				<h3>Helmet</h3>
				<p>Perhaps the most iconic piece of the Witch-king’s appearance is his menacing helmet—a twisted crown of black steel, forged into a terrifying silhouette that both conceals and declares. With jagged, spike-like protrusions rising from its crown, it serves as a chilling symbol of his royalty and his ruin. The helmet has no faceplate, for the Witch-king has no face to show—only darkness fills the void where eyes should be, a void that seems to stare back at anyone who dares to look. This absence is more frightening than any grotesque visage; it speaks of a soul lost, of a being hollowed out by Sauron’s will. Its edges are worn from countless battles, and yet it never dulls in presence. It is more than armor—it is an extension of the Witch-king’s legend, a crown of terror that lingers in the minds of all who glimpse it on the battlefield.

					<h3>From Mortal to Wraith</h3>
					<p>
						Once a mortal king, the Witch-king fell to the power of the Nine Rings and rose as the Lord of the Nazgûl. His transformation marked the beginning of an age of terror under Sauron’s dominion.

					<h3>"No Man Can Kill Me"</h3>

						Destined to fall by no man’s hand, his doom was sealed by Éowyn’s blade. His fall fulfilled prophecy and shattered the illusion of invincibility surrounding the Nazgûl.
