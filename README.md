[The Witch King of Angmar](the-witch-king-of-angmar.vercel.app) is a website made with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) (just for a client side trick for a mask-image with gif animation).

A key feature of the project is the integration of CSS Scroll-Linked Animations using the experimental animation-timeline property, enabling smooth, timeline-driven animations tied to scroll position â€” such as rotating cursed wheels, masked wire overlays, and depth-perspective transitions. The layout uses modern CSS Grid and flexbox, along with visual polish using filters, masking, and layering.

This project demonstrates a deep dive into cutting-edge CSS capabilities, focusing on performance, semantic structure, and immersive interaction â€” all without a single line of JavaScript (the only JS used is to handle and store the preferred theme).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project relies on experimental CSS animation-timeline feature, which is not supported in all browsers. I also noticed that the behaviour in mobile devices is not the same as in desktop because of the hide/show functionality of the address bar, so for the best experience, please use a desktop device
